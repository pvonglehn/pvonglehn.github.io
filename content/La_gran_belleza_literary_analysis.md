# Collaboration network
This collaboration network represents the 160 collaborators (authors, illustrators, editors, musicians etc.) who collaborated in the first 7 editions and/or launch parties of the _La gran belleza_. The edges connect the names of the editions with names of people. The names clustered in the middle collaborated on more than one edition.  

The graph was generated using networkX and then visualized using Gephi.

# Wordclouds
These wordclouds are made up of the most common words occurring in the 300 short stories submitted to the spring edition of of _La gran Belleza_, whose theme was 'vecinos' - neighbours. The text was processed by tokenizing and lemmatizing using spaCy and generating bigrams using gensim.
